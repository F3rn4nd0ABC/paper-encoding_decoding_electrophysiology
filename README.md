# Tutorials for Encoding/Decoding Models in Cognitive Neuroscience
This is a short collection of notebooks describing how to create encoding and decoding models of cognitive neuroscience. It focuses on auditory analysis using electrophysiological signals recorded from the brain. Check out the notebook `index.ipynb` for a description of these materials.

# Installing
* [This Binder link](http://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/choldgraf/paper-encoding_decoding_electrophysiology/master?filepath=index.ipynb) is the easiest way to quickly interact with this repository. It should allow you to run all of the analyses and code. (or click the badge below)

If you'd like to run the code locally, simply clone this repository, make sure you have all the packages installed in the `requirements.txt` file, and open a jupyter notebook session from within the root folder.
